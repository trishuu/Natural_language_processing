# Natural_language_processing
This comprehensive collection of NLP resources is designed to empower developers and researchers in their exploration and implementation of NLP techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to provide a wide range of tools, models, and examples to support your NLP projects.
Welcome to Syntactic Processing Code Demonstrations:
This README file is designed to navigate the code files and the datasets that have been used to demonstrate the use cases of various concepts taught in the Syntactic Processing module.

What is where?
Each file is placed in their well named respective folders and each folder contains three folders:

Code files: This is where you can find the notebooks that have been demonstrated in the module.
Dataset: This is where all the datasets you will need to run the notebooks are kept.
Commented code files: This is where one can find the well commented code files to wrie their own code along with the videos.
There are a total of 5 folders as mentioned below:

Heteronyms Detection POS Tagging Use Case: This folder contains the code files of heteronyms detection use case that have been demonstrated in PoS tagging session.
POS Tagging Case Study: This folder contains the code files and dataset of features extraction using PoS tagging case study that have been demonstrated in PoS tagging session.
Dependency Parsing: This folder contains the code files and dataset of active passive sentence detection use case that have been demonstrated in Parsing session.
NER Code Demonstration: This folder contains the code files of NER use case that have been demonstrated in NER and CRF session.
Custom NER Code Demonstration: This folder contains the code files and dataset of CRF use case that have been demonstrated in NER and CRF session.
